![](https://redstoneserver.000webhostapp.com/images/wide.png)

Redstone is an upcoming (1.17.1) Minecraft Server.

Underwork of porting to java from C#. Please bear with us!

Several programs/libraries created for Redstone will now be included as part of Redstone. They will be rebranded as "Redstone" software.
SmartBlocks -> Redstone Worlds

SmartNbt -> Redstone NBT

Minecraft Types will remain the same.

# Fully Featured (Soon)

  - Implementing the entire Minecraft Protocol
  - Will update with each new version
  - Easier to modify or extend then leading Minecraft server choices such a Bukkit.

The Goal for this software is to be one of the next top Minecraft Server Options available.
